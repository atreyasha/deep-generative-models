## Deep Generative Models using TensorFlow 2.0

This repository contains TensorFlow 2.0 python source-code for deep generative models. This repository prioritizes using low-level tensorflow implementations where possible. The intended purpose is to allow for a more in-depth understanding of corresponding algorithms.

Note: Source code in this repository was only tested on the CPU. Therefore extending usage to GPU(s) might result in issues.

### Dependencies

This repository's source code was tested with python versions `3.7.*`.

1. Install python dependencies located in `requirements.txt`:

    ```shell
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Optional: To develop this repository, it is recommended to initialize a pre-commit hook for automatic updates of python dependencies:

    ```shell
    $ ./init.sh
    ```

### Workflow

Information regarding execution of python scripts can be found in the [readme](/src/README.md) in the `/src` directory.
