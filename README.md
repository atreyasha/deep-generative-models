## Deep Generative Models using TensorFlow 2.0 Alpha

This repository contains TensorFlow 2.0 Alpha python (low-level) source-code for deep generative models. This repository focuses on using low-level tensorflow implementations instead of calling high-level wrappers. The intended purpose is to allow for a more in-depth understanding of corresponding algorithms.

In order to test this repository, it is recommended to initialize a pre-commit hook for automatic updates of `requirements.txt`:

```shell
$ ./init.sh
```

Information regarding execution of python scripts can be found in the [readme](/src/README.md) in the `/src` directory.
